Medical Software Design (BME547) is a course that I developed starting back in Fall 2016 semester when I realized that our students needed to have more experience with the foundational tools of software development in industry, including version control (git), unit testing, and continuous integration, along with exposure to web servers, RESTful APIs and databases.  

What I thought might be a small seminar of 10-15 students turned into a 50+ student class in its first offering, and it has remained popular ever since.  This course is typically taken by junior/senior undergraduate and graduate students.

I am not longer actively teaching this course, but Dr. David Ward currently offers one section each semester.  His online repository can be found here: [https://github.com/dward2/BME547](https://github.com/dward2/BME547).
