A comprehensive list of all of the open-source software and online data repositories that we have provided from our research.

* [Acoustic Radiation Force FEM Tools](https://github.com/mlp6/fem): Templates for creating simulations of ARFI/SWEI excitations in elastic, viscoelastic and anisotropic media.  LS-DYNA is the primary solver used in these simulations.

* [Ultrasonic Tracking Simulation Tools](https://github.com/mlp6/ultratrack): Field II-based tools to simulate ultrasonically-tracking ARF-induced motion in ARFI/SWEI.

* [Verasonics Phantom Sequences](https://github.com/RSNA-QIBA-US-SWS/VerasonicsPhantomSequences): Sequences and post-processing code to evaluate shear wave speed group and phase velocities in elastic and viscoelastic media (part of the RSNA QIBA US SWS effort). [Verasonic Processing Test Data](https://doi.org/10.7924/r4df6q75s) can be found in the Duke Digital Repository.

* [MimickNet](https://github.com/ouwen/mimicknet): Matching clinical-grade ultrasound post-processing without the hassle. Partially-beamformed and processing [ultrasound data](https://doi.org/10.7924/r49z94h1s) is available through the Duke Digital Repository.  This work is led by [Ouwen Huang](https://ouwen.io/).

* [Dermis Segmentation](https://github.com/fqjin/skin-segmentation): Two methods for segmenting skin on ultrasound B-mode images. This work is led by [Felix Jin](https://github.com/fqjin).

* [QIBA Ultrasound Shear Wave Speed Digital Phantoms](https://doi.org/10.7924/r4sj1f98c) are available online for validating SWEI algorithms in elastic and viscoelastic media.  The code associated with generating these data can be found here: [https://github.com/RSNA-QIBA-US-SWS/QIBA-DigitalPhantoms](https://github.com/RSNA-QIBA-US-SWS/QIBA-DigitalPhantoms).
