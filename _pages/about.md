This website contains syllabi and content for the courses that I teach in
medical device design, including summaries of past and current student
projects. I will also highlight recent research in acoustic radiation force
imaging, tissue characterization with shear waves, and deep learning in
medical imaging, and occasionally I'll upload some blog posts.

# Teaching
I actively teach [Medical Device Design I & II (BME473L &
BME474L)](https://github.com/mlp6/Medical-Device-Design) as part of the BME
Design Fellows program and senior capstone design. You can find a summary of
some student design projects here: [TODO].

I have also taught several other courses in the department, including
Introduction to Medical Instrumentation (BME354L), and I have developed
courses, including [Medical Software Design
(BME547L)](https://github.com/mlp6/Medical-Software-Design/) and Biomedical
Circuit Analysis (BME790L).

# Latest Research News
[TODO]

# Open-Source Software and Data Repositories
We highly value generating easily-accessible code and data for the research community.  This list highlights some of our latest shared contributions:

* [Acoustic Radiation Force FEM Tools](https://github.com/mlp6/fem): Templates for creating simulations of ARFI/SWEI excitations in elastic, viscoelastic and anisotropic media.  LS-DYNA is the primary solver used in these simulations.

* [Ultrasonic Tracking Simulation Tools](https://github.com/mlp6/ultratrack): Field II-based tools to simulate ultrasonically-tracking ARF-induced motion in ARFI/SWEI.

* [Verasonics Phantom Sequences](https://github.com/RSNA-QIBA-US-SWS/VerasonicsPhantomSequences): Sequences and post-processing code to evaluate shear wave speed group and phase velocities in elastic and viscoelastic media (part of the RSNA QIBA US SWS effort). [Verasonic Processing Test Data](https://doi.org/10.7924/r4df6q75s) can be found in the Duke Digital Repository.

* [MimickNet](https://github.com/ouwen/mimicknet): Matching clinical-grade ultrasound post-processing without the hassle. Partially-beamformed and processing [ultrasound data](https://doi.org/10.7924/r49z94h1s) is available through the Duke Digital Repository.  This work is led by [Ouwen Huang](https://ouwen.io/).

* [Dermis Segmentation](https://github.com/fqjin/skin-segmentation): Two methods for segmenting skin on ultrasound B-mode images. This work is led by [Felix Jin](https://github.com/fqjin).

* [QIBA Ultrasound Shear Wave Speed Digital Phantoms](https://doi.org/10.7924/r4sj1f98c) are available online for validating SWEI algorithms in elastic and viscoelastic media.  The code associated with generating these data can be found here: [https://github.com/RSNA-QIBA-US-SWS/QIBA-DigitalPhantoms](https://github.com/RSNA-QIBA-US-SWS/QIBA-DigitalPhantoms).

# COVID-19 Engineering Response Team
I have been involved with a highly-collaborative, inter-departmental effort
within the Pratt School of Engineering to help our medical center and campus
deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. You can read more about our efforts here:
