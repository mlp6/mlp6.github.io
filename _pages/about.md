This website contains syllabi and content for the courses that I teach in
medical device design, including summaries of past and current student
projects. I will also highlight recent research in acoustic radiation force
imaging, tissue characterization with shear waves, and deep learning in
medical imaging, and occasionally I'll upload some blog posts.

# Teaching
I actively teach [Medical Device Design I & II (BME473L &
BME474L)](https://github.com/mlp6/Medical-Device-Design) as part of the BME
Design Fellows program and senior capstone design. You can find a summary of
some student design projects here: TODO: INSERT LINK TO DESIGN PROJECTS PAGE.

I have also taught several other courses in the department, including
Introduction to Medical Instrumentation (BME354L), and I have developed
courses, including [Medical Software Design
(BME547L)](https://github.com/mlp6/Medical-Software-Design/) and Biomedical
Circuit Analysis (BME790L).

# Research
Active research topics will go here.

## Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Imaging
* Prostate

## Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging 
* Prostate
* MSK

## Deep Learning
* [MimickNet](https://github.com/ouwen/mimicknet): Matching clinical-grade
  ultrasound post-processing without the hassle. This work is led by [Ouwen
  Huang](https://ouwen.io/).
* [Dermis Segmentation](https://github.com/fqjin/skin-segmentation): Two
  methods for segmenting skin on ultrasound B-mode images. This work is led by
  [Felix Jin](https://github.com/fqjin).
