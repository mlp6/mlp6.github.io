The BME Design Fellows program was starting in Spring 2018 to help augment
the preparation of our students for careers in the medical device design
industry.
# Mission
The BME Design Fellows program was starting in the Spring 2018 semester.  It strives to accomplish several things:
* Expand Duke BME's traditional one-semester design experience to two semesters.
* Augment device prototyping skills in CAD, ECAD and PCB development.
* Introduce design sooner in a student's undergraduate experience, making them more competative for rising senior summer internships.
* Allow students to take advanced design electives in manufacturing, medical software development, regulatory or QMS.

# Online Applications
Application for this program occurs during the junior fall semester.  Applications are available online to complete during the month of September using this [online form](bme-design-fellows-application.palmeri.io).
